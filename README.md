# Overview

Hi guys! I am studying Computer Science and I want to continue learning new languages. Between my set of skills, I am not good at C++ so I decided to take action on it. I decided to learn the basics and a bit more of C++ language. So, I decided to create this small calculator and put on oractice multiple principles of the language, such as, variables, loops, expretions, conditionas, functions, and more.

This calculator is simple. It first ask the user for which baisc operation would like to use. Then it starts getting the numbers and adding them into a Queue which will be used to perform the calculation later. finally it prints the results in the console and a text file. 

AS I previouly mention. I wanted to learn the basic principles of C++ and start creating my own logical reasoning with it.
